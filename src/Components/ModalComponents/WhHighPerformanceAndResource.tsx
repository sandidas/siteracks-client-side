        One of the key features of business web hosting is unmetered traffic. This means you can have as many visitors to your site as you like without worrying about running out of bandwidth or data. This is essential if you're running e-commerce or other high-traffic sites.

        In addition, business web hosting typically comes with unlimited databases, which is essential if you have a lot of databases that need to be stored and accessed. This allows you to scale your business without worrying about hitting any limits.

      <p className="text-text text-base lg:leading-7">
        With unlimited email, you can create as many email accounts as you need, which is essential for any business. This allows you to create professional email addresses for all your team members and ensures you can communicate effectively with your customers.
