        We offer free SSL certificates for all our customers, providing an added layer of security for your site and its visitors. All data transmitted between your site and its visitors will be encrypted, making it much harder for malicious actors to intercept or steal sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text text-base lg:leading-7">
        In addition to SSL, we provide daily backups for all your sites. This means that even in the event of a data loss or corruption, you can quickly restore your site to a previous version and minimize any potential downtime. Our backups are securely stored off-site, ensuring they are always
        available when needed.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text text-base lg:leading-7">
        With our combination of security measures and daily backups, you can have peace of mind knowing that your sites are in good hands. We take the security of your sites seriously and are dedicated to providing you with the best possible protection. Whether you are running a small personal blog
        or a large e-commerce site, our security and backup solutions will ensure that your sites remain secure and accessible.
