          Online shopping has become a familiar and convenient way to purchase products and services. However, the increase in online transactions has also raised concerns about online security. To build trust with customers, websites must have an SSL certificate. An SSL certificate, or Secure
          Sockets Layer, is a type of security protocol that ensures data transmission between a website and its users is protected.
