          At our SiteRacks, we understand the importance of having a smooth and efficient development process. This is why we have initiated pre-installing Git on all our servers. By doing this, we aim to streamline your workflow and make it easier for you to focus on your core development tasks.
          With Git already installed, you won't waste time setting it up or encountering any technical difficulties that can slow down your progress.
