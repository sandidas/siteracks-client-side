        Payments for the purchase of any product can be done with the use of PayPal, Credit/Debit cards. By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our
        third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for all charges you incur for the purchase of any Subscriptions or other Products (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (each such purchase, an “Order”). You are responsible for, and agree to pay, all such charges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">Payment Due at Time of Order; Non-Refundable. You agree to pay all amounts due for Services at the time you order them. All amounts are non-refundable unless otherwise noted in the Refund policy.</p>
      <p className="text-text">
        Price Changes. SiteRacks reserves the right to change its prices and fees at any time, and such changes shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes in
        prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.

      <p className="text-text">
        Bandwidth charges. Outgoing bandwidth transfers will be used to compute bandwidth utilization for bundled packages to internet data transfers. Clients are liable for any bandwidth fees related with their material when it is accessed over the public internet. If a client's actual data
        transfer consumption exceeds the quantity mentioned in the applicable order, the customer will be charged the bandwidth overage cost. Siterack will not enable "hotlinking" capability; if "hotlinking" capability is activated at the request of the customer, the customer is still liable for any
        network consumption.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        <strong>Late Payments.</strong> If a client fails to pay any fees when they are due, Siterack may discontinue all services offered to that customer. Moreover, if a customer's outstanding debt is not paid when due, Siteracks may levy a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1½%) (or the
        maximum permissible rate, if less) of the unpaid balance every month.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        If Siterack receives a payment and it is returned due to insufficient funds, the customer must refund Siterack for any related processing fees as well as the late charge, if applicable. If non-disputed payments are received more than three times per year, Siterack may ask a deposit or
        payment with guaranteed money. Customers shall reimburse Siterack for any expenditures incurred in collecting any money owed under this agreement, including reasonable legal fees
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        Refunds Issued. You agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, SiteRacks's issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that SiteRacks has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale, and that SiteRacks has no control over when
        the refund will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance. You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund
        posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of
        refunds allowed, then SiteRacks, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit; (ii) via issuance of a SiteRacks check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file for your Account; or (iii) in some
        jurisdictions, as a bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method. SiteRacks also has the right to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        Monthly Billing Date. If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text">
        <strong>Auto-Renewal Terms.</strong> Other than as required by applicable law, SiteRacks does not retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to your usage of our automatic renewal services, and we are

      <p className="text-text font-bold">
        IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, ALL SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AUTOMATIC RENEWAL UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED ON THIS SITE. EXCEPT FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THIS SECTION, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS THE APPLICABLE SERVICE UPON
        EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD (EXCEPT FOR DOMAIN NAMES WHICH MAY RENEW FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD). FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR LAST SERVICE PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL TYPICALLY BE FOR ONE YEAR.
        HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT RENEWAL WITH THE PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE FAILS, SiteRacks MAY ATTEMPT TO RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR A PERIOD LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY FOR THE TRANSACTION TO SUCCEED.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text font-bold">

        THAT DATE. IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO CANCEL YOUR PRODUCT AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND SiteRacks SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.

        IN ADDITION, SiteRacks MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR BANK’S PARTICIPATION). IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER
        (OR YOUR BANK) MAY NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US. IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE
        TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, SiteRacks WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF. SiteRacks MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY

      <p className="text-text">If for any reason SiteRacks is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed, or if SiteRacks receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that SiteRacks may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. SiteRacks also reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks SiteRacks may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs SiteRacks may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by SiteRacks in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by SiteRacks staff or by outside firms retained by SiteRacks; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by SiteRacks as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor.

      <p className="text-text">SiteRacks may offer product-level pricing in various currencies. The transaction will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment.
